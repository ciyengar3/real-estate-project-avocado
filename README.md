# real-estate-project-avocado
This is our project that we wanted to work on.

Basically, here are development rules:

1. I set it up to manually deploy from the master branch. Make sure to check out a feature or bug branch,
do your shit, and merge it with master after a code review maybe.

2. Basically, let's go boys.

3. Also, make sure to install python 3.6.2, virtualenv, and pip. Once installed, run pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install all your shit you need locally. You can start a virtualenv and run this so you don't have to install
the requirements globally.

4. Install the Heroku CLI kit.

5. Do all your changes, and then run heroku local web. This will start a local host for local dev.

6. If everything checks out, then push to your branch and make a pull request. Ask me if you have questions.
